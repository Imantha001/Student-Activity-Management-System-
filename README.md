# Student Management System

This repository contains three separate tasks (`task1`, `task2`, and `task3`) for a Java-based Student Management System. Each task builds upon the previous one, adding more features and complexity.


## Features

### Task 1
- Basic student management using arrays.
- Features include:
  - Registering students.
  - Deleting students.
  - Sorting students by name.
  - Displaying the list of students.
  - Storing and loading student data from a file.

### Task 2
- Enhanced student management using `Student` and `Module` classes.
- Features include:
  - Adding student results.
  - Sorting students by name.
  - Displaying detailed student information, including module marks and grades.

### Task 3
- Advanced student management with additional features.
- Features include:
  - Generating a complete report of students.
  - Generating a system summary.
  - Sorting students by average marks in descending order.

## How to Run

1. Open the desired task folder (`task1`, `task2`, or `task3`) in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code).
2. Compile and run the `Main.java` file located in the `src` directory.
3. Follow the menu options displayed in the console to interact with the system.

## Data Files

Each task uses a `Student_Data.txt` file to store and load student information. Ensure this file is present in the root directory of the respective task folder.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
- An IDE or text editor that supports Java development.

## Notes

- Each task is independent and can be run separately.
- The `task2` and `task3` implementations use object-oriented programming concepts, while `task1` uses basic arrays.
